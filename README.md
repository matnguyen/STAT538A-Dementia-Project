## Scripts
* `exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`: contains the code for exploratory data analysis (e.g. correlation matrix, boxplots)
* `glm_fit.ipynb`: contains the code for fitting all generalized linear models on different response variables and with model selection (e.g. logistic regression, multinomial logistic regression, ordinal logistic regression)
* `glmm_fit.ipynb`: contains the code for fitting all generalized linear mixed models using different random effects with model selection (e.g. mixed-effects logistic regression)
* `ml_fit.ipynb`: contains the code for fitting traditional machine learning models on different response variables and with feature selection (e.g. random forests, support vector machines)
* `viz_results.ipynb`: contains the code for visualizing results
